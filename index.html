          <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
          <div class="interestit-para">
            <p>I have grown up with IT, it has always been a part of life, starting with the Commodore 64 when I was just 6. My interest in this area has gone through many different phases from creating Websites to App creation as well as the more general gaming, RollerCoaster Tycoon and Cities Skylines being some of my favourite time wasters.<p>
            <p>I remember when I was younger my step mum would always bring home different devices that her friends and family were getting rid of for me to build my first computer. Once complete it was a 686 Intel device that ran Windows 3.11.</p>
            <p>I now work for a company that started in Bowen QLD and now has offices in Townsville and Brisbane. I have been in my current role as an embedded Technician for 1 year at a great company that works with Mental Health and the NDIS, I cover 12 sites across Northern and Central Queensland.</p>

             <h2>Why RMIT?</h2>
            <div class="whyrimt-para">
              <p>My choice to come to RMIT was an easy one, when it came down to JCU or RMIT that is. I have always been told that RMIT is the best Uni for Information Technology courses and when researching for reviews it was hard to find a negative one. </p>
              <p>While studying I want to upgrade my current skill set and meet like minded people that are as nerdy as myself.</p>

              <p>For Consuls, life is sweetest when it’s shared with others. People with this personality type form the bedrock of many communities, opening their homes – and their hearts – to friends, loved ones, and neighbors.</p>
              <p>This doesn’t mean that Consuls like everyone, or that they’re saints. But Consuls do believe in the power of hospitality and good manners, and they tend to feel a sense of duty to those around them. Generous and reliable, people with this personality type often take it upon themselves – in ways both large and small – to hold their families and their communities together.</p>

              <p>If you are a tactile learner, you learn by touching and doing. You understand and remember things through physical movement. You are a "hands-on" learner who prefers to touch, move, build, or draw what you learn, and you tend to learn better when some type of physical activity is involved. You need to be active and take frequent breaks, you often speak with your hands and with gestures, and you may have difficulty sitting still. </p>
              <p>As a tactile learner, you like to take things apart and put things together, and you tend to find reasons to tinker or move around when you become bored. You may be very well coordinated and have good athletic ability. You can easily remember things that were done but may have difficulty remembering what you saw or heard in the process. You often communicate by touching, and you appreciate physically expressed forms of encouragement, such as a pat on the back.</p>

              <p>They say curiosity killed the cat but you recognise that is why cats have nine lives. Your relentless hunger to gain knowledge means you look far ahead while remaining congnizant of what is going on in the present. This ability to see gives you the confidence to take big risks. To gain the confidence and participation of others, you turn up the charm.</p>
              <p>However, you rarely need to be the centre of attention. When the big risks pay off you share success with everyone who made it possible.</p>

        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <div class="ppquestions">
          <p class="question">What do the results of the tests mean to you?</p>
          <p>The results of these tests mean very little to me in the end they pigeonhole people to thinking that they can only learn or lead in one way when in reality we grow and change when we get the experience and learn from the errors we have made. </p>
          <p class="question">How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</p>
          <p>I do not think the above results will have any bearing on how I interact with a team, I am always willing to listen to others’ opinions and to ask questions as to why the teammates think the way they do to get a better understanding.</p>
          <p class="question">How should you take this into account when forming a team?</p>
          <p>Being able to work with a lot of different people is a strength that I will bring to the team by using some of the different mechanisms that I have explained in the above two responses. </p>
