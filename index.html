    <h1>Personal InformatioN</h1>
    <p>Originally from the western suburbs of Victoria and currently living in Townsville QLD. I grew up being the middle child of 5 kids, my dad was from Sicily and mum from England. I met my husband when I was 21 and we have been together for 15 years and married now for 2 years, Got married in 2020 just before the QLD border closed to the rest of the country due to COVID.
I have always had animals around as pets and right now my house is like a zoo with 1 Southern Banjo, 3 Whites Tree Frogs, Leo (15-year-old Maine Coon), Pacer and Tangela (Cockatiels) and Spike (Rat).

    <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
       <p>I have grown up with IT as it has always been a part of life, starting with the Commodore 64 when I was just 6 and my interest in this area has gone through many different phases from creating Websites to App creation as well as the more general Gaming, RollerCoaster Tycoon and Cities Skylines being some of my favourite time wasters.
I remember when I was younger my step mum would always bring home different devices that her friends and family were getting rid of for me to build my first computer. Once complete it was a 686 Intel device that ran Windows 3.11.
I now work for a company that started in Bowen QLD and now has offices in Townsville and Brisbane. I have been in my current role as an embedded Technician for 1 year at a great company that works with Mental Health and the NDIS, I cover 12 sites across Northern and Central Queensland.</p>
    <h1> Why RMITM?</h1>
    <p>My choice to come to RMIT was an easy one, when it came down to JCU or RMIT that is. I have always been told that RMIT is the best Uni for Information Technology courses and when researching for reviews it was hard to find a negative one.
While studying I want to upgrade my current skill set and meet like minded people that are as nerdy as myself.</p>
